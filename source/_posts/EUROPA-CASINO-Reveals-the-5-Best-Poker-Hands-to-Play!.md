The 5 best poker hands to play at Europa Casino are: 

1. Aces-Suited
2. Kings-Suited
3. Queens-Suited
4. Tens-Suited
5. Aces-Unsuited

Aces-Suited - This is the best possible hand you can have in poker, and it ranks above all other hands. When playing with aces, it’s important to remember that you only need one of them to win the hand, so don’t be afraid to bet big. 
Kings-Suited - This is another very strong hand that can often take down the pot. If you have kings suited, be sure to raise preflop and play aggressively to try and take down the pot right away. 
Queens-Suited - Another high ranking hand, queens suited should be played cautiously early on, especially if there are a lot of opponents still in the hand. However, if you do hit a queen on the flop, be prepared to go all in! 
Tens-Suited - While not as strong as some of the other hands on this list, tens suited can still be very powerful if played correctly. Be sure to raise preflop with this hand and then let your opponents do the betting for you. 
Aces-Unsuited - This is another strong hand that can often take down a pot. If you have a pair of aces, be sure to raise preflop and then let your opponents battle it out among themselves.
