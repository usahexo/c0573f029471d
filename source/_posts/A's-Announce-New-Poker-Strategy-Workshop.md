#  Poker Stars Invade Oakland Coliseum

The PokerStars Championship marked the first time a poker tournament was hosted at the Oakland Coliseum. The multi-day event began on Jan. 26 and ended on Jan. 29 with dozens of professional poker players in attendance.

Players were vying for their share of the $1 million prize pool, including a top prize of $200,000. Among those in attendance were former world champions Vanessa Selbst and Joe McKeehen, as well as high-rolling pros Fedor Holz and Scott Blumstein.

Eventual winner Ben Yu took home the top prize after defeating a field of 49 players over three days of play. Yu’s final table included Amir Lehavot, who finished in second place, and Christopher Kruk, who placed third. This was Lehavot’s second runner-up finish at a PokerStars Championship event; he also finished second at the PokerStars Caribbean Adventure in 2017.

Yu’s victory was his biggest career score to date and came with a $200,000 payday. He is now ranked second on the all-time money list for Card Player magazine’s Player of the Year race with over $5 million in earnings.

The PokerStars Championship marked the latest major poker tournament to be hosted in California following last year’s launch of online poker in the state. With its legalization, California has become one of the world’s largest regulated online poker markets and is expected to generate over $100 million in annual revenue.
