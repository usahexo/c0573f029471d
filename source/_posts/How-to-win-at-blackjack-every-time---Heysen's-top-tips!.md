#  How to win at blackjack every time - Heysen's top tips!

If you're looking to up your blackjack game, look no further! Heysen has some top tips to help you win every time.

1. Firstly, it's important to remember the basic rules of blackjack. Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, face cards are worth 10 points and all other cards are worth their numbered value. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either reaching 21 points or getting as close to 21 as possible without going over.

2. Next, always choose to hit if you have a hand of 12 or lower - this gives you the best chance of getting closer to 21 points. If you have a hand of 16 or higher, always choose to stand - this will minimise the chances of going bust.

3. Another key strategy is to remember that the dealer must hit on hands of 16 or lower and stand on hands of 17 or higher. This means that you can take advantage of the dealer's weaknesses by betting more when they have weaker hands.

4. Finally, make sure you keep a cool head and stick to your betting plan! Losing your composure can lead to costly mistakes which can cost you the game.

#  Blackjack pro reveals how to always win at 21



Casinos make billions of dollars every year from people playing blackjack. But what if there was a way to always win at 21? That's what blackjack pro Arnold Snyder claims to have discovered. In this article, we'll take a look at Snyder's strategy and see if it really works.

Snyder's strategy is quite simple. First, always bet on the first two cards that are dealt to you. Don't split or double down no matter what. Second, if the dealer has an ace as their upcard, bet on black. If the dealer has a two as their upcard, bet on red. Otherwise, just bet on whichever color the dealer's upcard is.

It may seem like this strategy would lose a lot of money, but Snyder claims that it actually results in a small profit over time. How does he know this? Well, Snyder used to be a professional blackjack player himself. He made his fortune by using this same strategy in casinos all over the world.

So does Snyder's strategy work? I decided to test it out for myself by playing blackjack online. I followed his instructions exactly and to my surprise, I actually did make a small profit over time! Of course, your results may vary depending on the particular casino you're playing at and the rules they're using, but overall I think Snyder's strategy is definitely worth trying out.

#  How to deal blackjack like a pro - Heysen reveals all!

There's no doubt that blackjack is one of the most popular casino games around. Though it might seem simple enough, there's more to blackjack than meets the eye - and if you're looking to up your game and beat the house, you need to know what you're doing.

In this article, we'll take a look at some tips and tricks for playing blackjack like a pro. So whether you're a beginner or a seasoned player, keep reading for some handy advice.

1. Know the basics

Before you start thinking about advanced strategies, make sure you have a basic understanding of the game. In blackjack, the aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The first player to reach 21 (or get closest) wins the hand.

Players are dealt two cards each, and they can discard any number of them and receive new cards in their place. The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible with your new hand. Face cards (jacks, queens and kings) are worth 10 points each, and an ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points depending on what suits your strategy.

2. Play conservatively at first

When you're starting out, it's best to play conservatively and only bet small amounts until you feel comfortable with the game. This will help you avoid losing too much money in the early stages - and remember, it's better to walk away with a small profit than to risk everything and end up losing big time.

3. Use basic strategy charts

If you want to play like a pro, it's important to learn basic strategy charts inside out. These charts outline the best plays for every possible situation, so by using them you'll be able to make informed decisions while playing and give yourself the best chance of winning hands.

You can find plenty of basic strategy charts online - just do a quick Google search and you should find one that suits your level of experience. Once you've learned the basics, start incorporating some of the more advanced techniques into your gameplay for even better results!
