#  Malaysia's Gambling Laws Cause Confusion for Foreigners 

Since 2014, the Malaysian government has imposed a blanket ban on all gambling activities. This ban includes online gambling, sports betting, and casino games. The ban was implemented in order to protect the interests of Malaysian citizens and to prevent crime.

However, the blanket ban has caused a great deal of confusion for foreigners living in Malaysia. Many people are not sure if it is legal to gamble in Malaysia or not. Gambling is illegal in most Islamic countries, and Malaysia is a Muslim-majority country. However, there are some exceptions to the rule.

The first exception is that foreign nationals are allowed to gamble at casinos in certain designated areas. These areas include:
- Genting Highlands Resort
- Resorts World Genting
- Cruise ships travelling between Singapore and Malaysia
- Penang 2nd Bridge Integrated Resort Project

The second exception is that foreign nationals are allowed to bet on horse races at certain designated race tracks. These race tracks include:
- The Kranji Racecourse in Singapore
- The Selangor Turf Club in Kuala Lumpur
- The Ipoh Turf Club in Perak 
- The Penang Turf Club in Penang

If you are a foreigner living in Malaysia and you want to gamble, it is important to know where you are allowed to do so. If you are caught gambling outside of these designated areas, you could be arrested and deported from the country.
