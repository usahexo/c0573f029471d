The key to reading baseball betting trends is to look at the history of the team and their matchups.

For example, if the Cubs are playing against a team that is known for their powerful bats, then you would want to bet on the Cubs if they have a pitcher who is known for his ability to shut down opposing hitters. Conversely, if the Cubs are playing against a weaker team, you might want to bet on them if they have a pitcher who tends to give up runs.

For example, if the current odds are in favour of the Cubs, then this might be a good time to bet on them. However, if the odds are in favour of their opponents, then it might be wiser to bet on the other team instead.

# Analyzing The 2016 Chicago Cubs: How To Read Sports Betting Trends 

The 2016 Chicago Cubs are one of the most interesting teams in baseball. They were dominant in the regular season, but fell short in the playoffs. In this article, we will analyze the Cubs and how to read sports betting trends.

The Cubs finished the 2016 season with a 103-58 record. This was good enough for first place in the National League Central Division. The Cubs then went on to win their first playoff series since 2003. However, they were ultimately defeated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series.

There are a few things that stand out about the 2016 Cubs. First, they led all of baseball in runs scored (823). They also had the second lowest team ERA (3.15) and the second highest batting average (.263).

The Cubs offense is led by Anthony Rizzo and Kris Bryant. Rizzo batted .292 with 32 homers and 109 RBIs in 2016. Bryant batted .292 with 39 homers and 102 RBIs. These two players are arguably the best 1-2 punch in all of baseball.

However, the biggest question mark for the Cubs is their pitching staff. ace Jon Lester struggled down the stretch and was eventually replaced by Kyle Hendricks as the team’s number one starter. Hendricks had a tremendous season, posting a 2.13 ERA in 26 starts. However, Jake Arrieta, John Lackey, and Brett Anderson are all question marks heading into 2017.

Despite their shortcomings, the Cubs are still one of the best teams in baseball and should be considered favorites to win the World Series in 2017.
