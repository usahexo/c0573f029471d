      		<h1 id="Why-oxbet-chose-Phoenix-Suns"><a href="#Why-oxbet-chose-Phoenix-Suns" class="headerlink" title="Why oxbet chose Phoenix Suns?"></a>Why oxbet chose Phoenix Suns?</h1><p>Phoenix Suns is an American professional basketball team based in Phoenix, Arizona. The Suns compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member team of the league’s Western Conference Pacific Division. Founded in 1968, the team played its first season in 1969. The Suns are one of just two original NBA teams still located in its original city (the other being the Boston Celtics).</p>
<p>Owner Robert Sarver announced on October 24, 2017, that the Suns would be changing their name to “oxbet” to coincide with their new naming rights sponsorship with oxbet.com. The Suns home arena is now known as “The oxbet Center”, and all references to “Phoenix Suns” or “Suns” within team branding and marketing will be replaced with “oxbet”.</p>
<p>Why oxbet choose Phoenix Suns?</p>
<p>There are several reasons why oxbet chose Phoenix Suns as their new sponsor:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Phoenix is a major market with a large population base.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Suns are an established team with a long history and a loyal fan base.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Suns play in the Western Conference, which is considered to be more competitive than the Eastern Conference. This will provide greater exposure for oxbet.com.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Suns have a strong ownership group that is committed to success. Owner Robert Sarver is passionate about basketball and has a proven track record of building winning teams.</p>

<h1 id="Why-Hugo-is-the-team’s-mascot"><a href="#Why-Hugo-is-the-team’s-mascot" class="headerlink" title="Why Hugo is the team’s mascot?"></a>Why Hugo is the team’s mascot?</h1><p>For as long as Sacramento Kings fans can remember, there has been a furry green creature gracing the sidelines of games and photoshoots. But what is this creature, and where did it come from? The answer may surprise you.</p>
<p>It all started over 15 years ago, when the team was searching for a new mascot. They decided on Hugo, a lovable green monster with a comical personality. Fans loved his antics and his passion for the game.</p>
<p>In addition to being an essential part of game day, Hugo also makes regular appearances in the community. He visits schools, hospitals, and charity events, spreading joy to everyone he meets. He’s even made an appearance at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade!</p>
<p>Hugo is more than just a mascot; he’s one of the team’s most beloved ambassadors. He represents everything that’s good about the Sacramento Kings: fun-loving spirit, commitment to giving back to the community, and unbridled enthusiasm for the game of basketball. Thanks, Hugo - we love you too!</p>
<h1 id="How-did-the-Suns-come-to-be-named"><a href="#How-did-the-Suns-come-to-be-named" class="headerlink" title="How did the Suns come to be named?"></a>How did the Suns come to be named?</h1><p>There are a few popular stories about how the Phoenix Suns got their name. One story is that the team was originally going to be called the “Arizona Sun Devils”. However, when they went to trademark the name, they found out that there was already a team called the “Sun Devils” in New Jersey.</p>
<p>So then the team’s owners held a contest to come up with a new name, and “Suns” was the winning entry. Another story is that the team was originally going to be called the “Phoenix Tarzans”, but when they found out that there was already a team called the “Tarzans” in Virginia, they decided to go with “Suns” instead.</p>
<p>There’s also a story that says that the team’s original owner, Jerry Colangelo, was inspired by the mythological bird known as the Phoenix. The Phoenix is known for being able to reborn itself from ashes, and Colangelo thought this would be a good metaphor for how his new basketball team could rise from obscurity and become successful.</p>

They were one of the expansion teams that joined the NBA in the late 60s.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-Suns’-all-time-leading-scorers"><a href="#Who-are-the-Suns’-all-time-leading-scorers" class="headerlink" title="Who are the Suns’ all-time leading scorers?"></a>Who are the Suns’ all-time leading scorers?</h1><p>The Phoenix Suns are a professional basketball team based in Phoenix, Arizona.

The Suns have qualified for the postseason 22 times and have reached the Western Conference Finals four times. The Suns are led by head coach Igor Kokoskov and general manager James Jones.</p>
<p>The Suns’ all-time leading scorer is Paul Westphal, who played for the Suns from 1972 to 1980. Westphal scored 12,192 points in his seven seasons with the Suns.
