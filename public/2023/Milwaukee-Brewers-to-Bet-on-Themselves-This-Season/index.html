                <h1>Milwaukee Brewers to Bet on Themselves This Season</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Milwaukee-Brewers-to-Bet-on-Themselves-This-Season"><a href="#Milwaukee-Brewers-to-Bet-on-Themselves-This-Season" class="headerlink" title="Milwaukee Brewers to Bet on Themselves This Season"></a>Milwaukee Brewers to Bet on Themselves This Season</h1><p>It would be easy for the Milwaukee Brewers to say that they were a little unlucky last season. They finished just two games out of a playoff spot, but they also suffered some key injuries. This year, the Brewers are betting on themselves.</p>
<p>Milwaukee made a few key additions this offseason. Most notably, they added Lorenzo Cain and Christian Yelich in free agency. These two players are both tremendous athletes and should help the Brewers win a lot of games.</p>
<p>In addition to the new additions, the Brewers also have some star players returning from injury. Ryan Braun missed significant time last season, but he is now healthy and ready to go. The same is true for ace pitcher Jimmy Nelson. When Nelson is healthy, he is one of the best pitchers in baseball.</p>
<p>The Brewers have also made some improvements to their pitching staff. They brought in Jhoulys Chacin to be their number two starter and signed Matt Albers as a relief pitcher. Chacin had a good season last year with the San Diego Padres and Albers has been one of the most consistent relievers in baseball over the past few years.</p>
<p>All of these factors point to one thing: the Milwaukee Brewers are going to be a good team this year. They may not be able to compete with teams like the Boston Red Sox or Houston Astros, but they should be able to make it into the playoffs as one of the Wild Card teams.</p>
<h1 id="Chicago-Cubs-Looking-to-Repeat-as-NL-Central-Champs"><a href="#Chicago-Cubs-Looking-to-Repeat-as-NL-Central-Champs" class="headerlink" title="Chicago Cubs Looking to Repeat as NL Central Champs"></a>Chicago Cubs Looking to Repeat as NL Central Champs</h1><p>The Chicago Cubs come into the 2017 season as defending National League Central champions. This team is looking to repeat as division champions and make a deep run in the playoffs.</p>
<p> Led by manager Joe Maddon, the Cubs have a talented roster that is capable of winning it all. They are led offensively by Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, and Ben Zobrist. All three players hit over .290 last season and provide a good mix of power and speed.</p>
<p>The Cubs also have a strong pitching staff led by Jon Lester, Jake Arrieta, and Kyle Hendricks. Lester and Arrieta are both former Cy Young award winners, while Hendricks had a breakout season in 2016, winning the National League ERA title.</p>
<p>If the Cubs can stay healthy, they should be a very dangerous team in the playoffs. They have plenty of firepower offensively and a starting rotation that can match up with anyone in baseball. If they can once again win the NL Central division, they will be one of the favorites to win the World Series.</p>
<h1 id="Pittsburgh-Pirates-Poised-for-Another-Playoff-Run"><a href="#Pittsburgh-Pirates-Poised-for-Another-Playoff-Run" class="headerlink" title="Pittsburgh Pirates Poised for Another Playoff Run"></a>Pittsburgh Pirates Poised for Another Playoff Run</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Pirates are coming off of a successful season in which they made it to the playoffs for the third consecutive year. However, they were ultimately eliminated by the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLDS. This year, the Pirates look poised to make another playoff run, as they currently hold a lead in the NL Central Division.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ offense has been led by their captain and superstar, Andrew McCutchen. McCutchen is batting .292 with 16 home runs and 52 RBIs this season. He has also scored 68 runs and stolen 11 bases. His teammates have stepped up when needed, as well. Starling Marte is batting .287 with 10 home runs and 37 RBIs, while Gregory Polanco is batting .279 with 11 home runs and 43 RBIs this season.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ pitching staff has also been solid this season. Gerrit Cole is 9-5 with a 2.80 ERA and 1.08 WHIP in 18 starts this season. Francisco Liriano is 8-5 with a 3.27 ERA and 1.24 WHIP in 18 starts this season. Jeff Locke is 5-5 with a 3.74 ERA in 15 starts this season, while Charlie Morton is 3-7 with a 4.54 ERA in 16 starts this season.</p>
<p>Overall, the Pirates seem to be one of the strongest teams in the National League this year, and they should be able to make it all the way to the World Series if they continue to play well down the stretch.</p>
<h1 id="Cincinnati-Reds-Eyeing-a-Return-to-Relevance"><a href="#Cincinnati-Reds-Eyeing-a-Return-to-Relevance" class="headerlink" title="Cincinnati Reds Eyeing a Return to Relevance"></a>Cincinnati Reds Eyeing a Return to Relevance</h1><p>The Cincinnati Reds got off to a hot start in 2018, but they faltered down the stretch and failed to make the playoffs. They’re poised for a rebound in 2019, and they could be one of the most exciting teams in baseball this season.</p>
<p>The Reds have a young up-and-coming nucleus that includes Joey Votto, Eugenio Suarez, Nick Senzel, Jesse Winker, and Tyler Mahle. They also have some veteran cornerstones in Brandon Phillips, Scooter Gennett, and Raisel Iglesias.</p>
<p>Manager David Bell has his work cut out for him this season. He’ll need to find a way to get all of these players on the same page and on the same page quickly. If he can do that, the Reds will be a force to be reckoned with in 2019.</p>
<p>The Reds have made some offseason moves to bolster their roster. They’ve added starting pitchers Alex Wood and Tanner Roark, as well as closer Wade Davis. These moves should help them compete in the tough National League Central Division.</p>
<p>The Cardinals are the favorites to win the division this year, but the Reds are right up there with them. They’ll need to stay healthy and play up to their potential if they want to unseat the Cardinals at the top of the division standings.</p>
<p>It should be an interesting season in Cincinnati!</p>
<h1 id="St-Louis-Cardinals-Remain-the-Team-to-Beat-in-the-NL-Central"><a href="#St-Louis-Cardinals-Remain-the-Team-to-Beat-in-the-NL-Central" class="headerlink" title="St. Louis Cardinals Remain the Team to Beat in the NL Central"></a>St. Louis Cardinals Remain the Team to Beat in the NL Central</h1><p>The St. Louis Cardinals are the team to beat in the NL Central. They have been the most consistent team in the division, and they have the best record in the division.</p>
<p>The Cardinals have a talented roster, and they are led by manager Mike Matheny. Matheny is a great manager, and he has a lot of experience. He knows how to win, and he knows how to motivate his players.</p>
<p>The Cardinals also have a strong pitching staff. They have a starting rotation that features Carlos Martinez, Adam Wainwright, Lance Lynn, Michael Wacha, and John Lackey. Martinez is one of the best pitchers in the league, and he will be a Cy Young contender this year. Wainwright is also a top pitcher, and Lynn, Wacha, and Lackey are all capable starters.</p>
<p>The Cardinals also have one of the best bullpens in baseball. Closer Trevor Rosenthal is one of the best closers in the league, and set-up man Kevin Siegrist is also very good. The Cardinals bullpen also features Matt Bowman, Tyler Lyons, Seth Maness, Jonathan Broxton, and Seung Hwan Oh.</p>
<p>The Cardinals offense is also very good. They have a line-up that features Matt Carpenter, Jhonny Peralta, Stephen Piscotty, Kolten Wong, Brandon Moss, Aledmys Diaz, Yadier Molina, and Jeremy Hazelbaker. Carpenter is one of the most underrated hitters in baseball, and Peralta is a very good hitter as well. Wong is an excellent offensive second baseman, and Moss can hit for power. Diaz is off to a hot start this year, and Molina remains one of the best catchers in baseball. Hazelbaker has been impressive so far this season as well.</p>
<p>The Cardinals are definitely the team to beat in the NL Central this year. They have the talent and experience to make a run at the World Series championship.</p>
